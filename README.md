Data Preprocessing

We download our Chinese handwriting character data at CASIA:http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/databases/handwriting/Home.html. 
The version we use is HWDB1.1trn_gnt and HWDB1.1tst_gnt. HWDB1.1 includes 3,755 GB2312-80 level-1 Chinese characters and 171 alphanumeric and symbols. 

It is easy to use Python to convert images. We import Image from PIL to convert gnt file to JPG file.
